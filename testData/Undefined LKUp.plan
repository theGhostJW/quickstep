==== Removal and Maintenance of Duplicate Summons and Invalid Summons, Judgments and Bankruptcies (Bankruptcies NZ Only) from CCB [EN-1697] ==== 

	The folowing tests relate to http://jira.dba.corp:8080/browse/EN-1697.
	
	It is important that no invalid or duplicate summons, bankruptcies and judgements exist on the CCB database as such records artificially reduce a Patient's credit rating. It is the purpose of this change is to:
	1) Remove existing records that are duplicates or deemed invalid
	2) Change the PubRec and Internal services (Au and NZ) such that invalid records will no longer be inserted
	3) Related logging
	
	Note that since the inception of this change AU bankruptcies have been redesigned and have consequntly been descoped from this change.
